! Program to compute a random walk in 1D with Monte Carl method.
! This can be easily extended to higher dimensions.


program random_walk_1d

    use, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env, only: sp=>real32, dp=>real64

    implicit none

    integer :: N ! The number of steps.

    ! The array of random numbers.
